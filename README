Notes: Dependencies
================

I do not believe in WYSIWYG or front-end markup-enhancing dependencies for
reusable apps, those choices should be left to the application consumer.
As-is, entries are editable in a standard TextBox.  Feel free to change
the widget!

I highly recommend sorl-thumbnail for use in your templates for displaying
resized and cropped images.

Notes: Static content
=====================

When images are uploaded in the admin, they will be sent to:
MEDIA_ROOT/apps/blogyall/images
Make sure the webserver has write-permission to that folder.
