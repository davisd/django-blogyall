Dependencies
============

1. django-tagging
 
Notes: Dependencies
================

As-is, entries are editable in a standard TextBox.  Feel free to change
the widget!

I highly recommend sorl-thumbnail for use in your templates for displaying
resized and cropped images.

Notes: Static content
=====================

When images are uploaded in the admin, they will be sent to:
MEDIA_ROOT/apps/blogyall/images
Make sure the webserver has write-permission to that folder.

Notes: Settings
===============
Default blogyall settings are in the settings module (settings.py). Variables
can be overriden by setting the variables in your project's settings.py module.

Notes: Settings: Ping Google
============================
To have the blog app attempt to ping google when a published blog post is saved,
set BLOG_PING_GOOGLE=True in your settings.py
